# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System
This is a small project of mine to practice my skills and knowledge learned about machine learning. The project is entirely written in Python using a web application framework based on Python called Streamlit to create a local website and can be deployed (not yet completed) to showcase the project.

In this project, the techniques presented are logistic regression, XGBoost, and RandomForest to train and predict regression values with the train and test sets obtained from Kaggle. 
### Some contents of the project are:
- The techniques of data splitting for training, testing, and predicting results, as well as saving the model with the highest accuracy are presented.
- Understand how to use Machine Learning algorithms for practical projects.
- Have knowledge about machine learning.
- Know how to develop a small personal project with Streamlit.
